        My computer biography is that I have been pretty much messing with computers
        since I was in my diapers. My dad has been a huge influence on me and why
        I have such a huge interest in computers in the first place. Because of
        that we have always had broken and working computers, printers, and
        copiers around the house that I could mess with and learn about.
      </p>

        Since then I have received an Associates of Sceince in Computer Science
        at Sierra College and now I'm working on my Bachelor's degree in
        Computer Information Systems at CSU Chico.
        What motivated me to make this Github account and to take this web design
        course is that for one I need it to graduate but for two it has been well
        over 10 years since I have touched HTML or CSS and it has been really nice
        to take a refresh on it since at least as far as CSS is concerened a lot has
         changed since I last coded anything in it.
