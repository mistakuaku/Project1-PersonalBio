        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Welcome to my page! My name is Patrick McGee and this little site is a
        place where you can learn a little bit about me. You can think of this
        as a sort of blog, short history about myself, and a portfolio my works
         all combined into one convenient place.
      </p>

        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        I'm a computer information systems major at CSU Chico. I aim to graduate
        in the fall of 2018 so just about 3 more semesters and I am excited to
        say that! It has been a long time coming to be honest.
