        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Welcome to my page! My name is Patrick McGee and this little site is a
        place where you can learn a little bit about me. You can think of this
        as a sort of blog, short history about myself, and a portfolio my works
         all combined into one convenient place.

        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        I'm a computer information systems major at CSU Chico. I aim to graduate
        in the fall of 2018 so just about 3 more semesters and I am excited to
        say that! It has been a long time coming to be honest. Speaking of long
        this school year has been really long but it is not because the school
        work has been hard.

        Sure the school work can be tough and it can pile up on you at a moments
        notice but that stuff I can relatively control. The things that have been
        killing me this year is the stuff I can't control. One of those things
        is of course the crazy weather we've been having. It has flooded my place in Chico,
        started an electircal fire, and it also knocked a tree over ontop of my home
        in Sacramento. The worst part the tree specifically hit my room and went
        right through the roof! Now let me note this all happened before this semester
        started. Just my luck later in this semester the Oroville damn decided
        to have some problems.

        Anyways luck has not been my friend this year but at least my grades have
        been especially good this year. Now if this little rant didn't scare you
        away you can find out more about me by using the navybar at the top and
        find out a little more detailed information about me and not just a summary
        of all the trouble I've had lately.
